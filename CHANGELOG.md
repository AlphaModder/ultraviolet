## 0.6
- Significantly improve performance of Rotors and transform types (Isometry, Similarity)
- Add support for f64/double precision floats. Naming convention is `D[TypeName]` for the f64 versions.
- Upgrade `wide` to 0.5.x
- Rename `W[TypeName]` to `[TypeName]x4`, allowing room for `[TypeName]x8` and `[TypeName]x16`.
- Add support for 256 bit AVX vectors.
- Add support for `packed_simd` under "nightly" feature flag (required nightly Rust compiler)
- Under `nightly` feature, add support for 512-bit wide SIMD vectors (can often be a perf trap, though. 256 bit is often the fastest option for non-highly-specific algorithms).
- Rename `[WideType]::merge()` to `[WideType]::blend()`
- Add `wgpu`-specfic notes to `projection` module (adds `_wgpu` to some function names)
- Add spherical linear interpolation and better docs around interpolation
- Add `Into<Vec2; N> for Vec2xN` implementations
- Fix some doc comments not appearing properly on Vec and Mat types.
- Make most initializers `const`
